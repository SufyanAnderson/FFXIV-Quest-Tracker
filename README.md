An application that allows users to input the name of the quest, the quest description. Then add the characters
name that is currently being played on to know which character is playing what quest.

# Tech Used: HTML, CSS, EJS, Express 
This project took HTML, CSS, EJS, and express to get the desired result. 
# Lessons Learned
This was my fourth time using Authentication in an app. I learned how to put a new feature
that allows an item to be add to each new entry. I used it to keep track of the quest that the specific
characters are currently completing.
